# First Contributions

|<img alt="JetBrains IDEs" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/1a/JetBrains_Logo_2016.svg" width="40">|JetBrains IDEs (WebStorm, PyCharm .etc)|
|---|---|

JetBrains IDE's meet the complete requirment that professional developers seek within an IDE itself, with many different versions dealing with various coding environments.
1. To use git in JetBrains IDE, firstly make sure you have git installed on your computer
[Download Git Installer](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
2. Download and install any IDE (you will need to purchase a license, some IDEs are offered with a generous free trail. If you are a student then you can get a one year evaluation license.)
[Learn More](https://www.jetbrains.com)
3. For the purpose of this tutorial, we will work with WebStorm but don't worry, this will work with mostly every IDE provided with JetBrains.

## Fork this repository

<img align="right" width="300" src="assets/fork.png" alt="fork this repository" />

Fork this repo by clicking on the fork button on the top right of this page. This will create of copy of this repository in your GitHub account.

GitHub keeps track of the relationship between your repo and the one you have forked it from.  You can think of your repo as a working copy.

Most top-level GitHub repos (i.e. ones not forked from any other repo) have a small core team of people who can directly commit changes.  All other contributors must fork the repo and make changes in the fork, then create a Pull Request to ask for their changes to be merged back into the top-level repo. If the top-level repo administrator likes the changes they will be merged and you will gain instant fame and fortune!  More on how to do that later.

## Clone your repository

<img align="right" width="300" src="assets/clone.png" alt="clone this repository" />

The next step is to clone your repo down to your machine so you can begin making changes. WebStorm needs the URL of your repo, so click the "clone" button and then click the "copy to clipboard" icon.

**CAREFUL:** One mistake that new contributors often make is to clone the repo you forked *from* rather than cloning your repo.  Check your browser's address bar and make sure you are cloning your repo.

Now open up WebStorm. The welcome page of WebStorm will pop up. From there click on the 3rd option on the left stating `Check out from Version Control`. Select Git from the dropdown and a dialog box will appear.
Enter the Copied URL in the dialog box. and click on `test` to check and establish connection with that repository.

Then log into GitHub using the button provided and enter your login details. this will be used in the future to make commits and changes.
A progress box will appear which will go through the process of cloning the repository and saving it on your local machine.

## Create a branch

Navigate to the bottom right corner and find the Git: command box, there make a new branch to make changes to the code. [What does checkout mean?](https://www.git-scm.com/docs/git-checkout)

## Make necessary changes

Open `Contributors.md` and add your name anywhere in the file. This file contains GFM (GitHub Flavored Markdown) which is a proprietary flavor of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown">markdown</a> syntax.

Copy one of the other contributors&apos; lines and modify it with your name to make sure you get the syntax right - it can be picky.

Navigate to the bottom left corner to the `Version Control` tab which will open the VCS Prompt.

## Commit & Push changes to GitHub

Click on the commit changes icon which will open a compare dialog box showing all the changes you have made. Add a descriptive commit message and proceed.

On the bottom right of the Dialog Box there will be an option to commit.
Click on the dropdown arrow and select `commit and push`

This will make changes in your local directory and open the push dialog box. make sure all changes are final and click on `push`.

## Submit your changes for review

At this point you have completed your change but it still only resides in your repo.  This step will show you how to submit a request to the administrator of the top-level repo to merge your change.

In your repo on GitHub you'll see the `Compare & pull request` button next to the new branch notification. Click on that button.

<img src="assets/compare-and-pull.png" alt="create a pull request" />

Now submit the pull request.

Soon after review, we will be merging all your changes into the master branch of this project. You will get a notification email once the changes have been merged.
