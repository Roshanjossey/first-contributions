You must run the files locally on your desktop.

In order to do that:

1. Move to the directory where `package.json` is located.

    _Please note that npm is distributed with Node.js. This means that when you download Node.js, npm is automatically installed on your computer._

## Code of Conduct
If you would like to contribute, you must first read the [Code of Conduct](../CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

## Translation Guide
We have some rules for translation. If you are the first person to create a translation for your language, it is required that you add your language to the list found in `Translations.md`.

#### Example

`Translations.md`
```markdown

```
