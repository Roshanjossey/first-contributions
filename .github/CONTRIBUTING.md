# Contribution guide

Welcome to your first contribution! :heart:

#### Before Contributing:
You must run the files locally on your desktop.

In order to do that:

Move to the location where the `package.json` file is located

- Install the latest version of npm (Node Package Manager) -
    npm is distributed with Node.js - which means that when you download Node.js,
    npm is automatically installed on your computer.
    [get npm](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm)
- Install all the dependencies used by this project.
   Use this command:  `install npm`

- Run these final commands to run it locally:

  `npm run build`
  
  `npm start`

We have some rules for translation. If you are the first person to create a translation for your language, it is reqired that you add your language to the list found in `Translations.md`.

#### Example

`Translations.md`
```markdown

```
