## Why use branches

In team settings, when a group of people are contributing to the same repository, committing and pushing to the master 
branch can result in git conflicts which would be extremely time consuming to resolve. Git branches are lightweight copies of
code such thatchanges to a branch will not affect other branches, and you can share branches with others without having 
to merge the changes into the main project. You can create new branches to isolate changes for a feature or a bug fix from your 
master branch and other work.Git branches help in effective merging from tested development environment to production.
