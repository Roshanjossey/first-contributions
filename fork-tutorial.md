# First Contributions

|<img alt="Fork" src="https://git-fork.com/images/logo.png" width="100">|Fork Edition|
|---|---|

It's hard. It's always hard the first time you do something.
Especially when you are collaborating, making mistakes isn't a comfortable thing.
But open source is all about collaboration & working together.
We wanted to simplify the way new open-source contributors learn & contribute for the first time.

Reading articles & watching tutorials can help, but what comes better than actually doing the stuff without messing up anything.
This project aims at providing guidance & simplifying the way rookies make their first contribution.
Remember the more relaxed you are the better you learn.
If you are looking for making your first contribution just follow the simple steps below.
We promise you, it will be fun.

If you don't have Fork on your machine, [install it](https://git-fork.com).

## Set up Fork

For the easiest workflow, open up Fork and sign in with your GitHub account.

<img align="right" width="300" src="assets/fork.png" alt="fork this repository" />

## Fork this repository

Fork this repo by clicking on the fork button on the top right of this page.\
This will create of copy of this repository in your account.

## Clone the repository

<img style="left;" src="assets/fork-clone1.png" alt="Clone this repository" />

In Fork, click on `Add Repository âŒ„` and then `Clone...`, or go to `File` > `Clone...`.

<img style="left;" src="assets/fork-clone2.png" alt="Clone this repository" />

If you signed in with your GitHub account, click on `GitHub` and pick the correct repository, or use the git URL from the web.\
After you click on `Clone`, the contents of the repository will be downloaded to your computer.

## Create a branch

Now create a branch by clicking on the "Create new branch" icon in the toolbar ![](assets/fork-new-branch-icon.png | height=20), or click `Repository` > `New Branch...`.

<img style="left;" src="assets/fork-branch1.png" alt="Make a branch" />

Name your branch `add-<your-name>`. For example, `add-john-smith`.\
Click on `Create and Checkout`.

## Make necessary changes and commit those changes

Now open `Contributors.md` file in a text editor, scroll to the bottom of the page and add your name to it, then save the file. 

Example: If your name is John Smith, It should look like this.

\[John Smith](https://github.com/johnsmith)

You can see that there are changes to `Contributors.md` and they have been added to the Github Desktop.

First stage the file (since you want to include it in your commit).

<img style="left;" src="assets/fork-commit2.png" alt="Stage file" />

Now commit the staged files.\
Write the message "Add `<your-name>` to Contributors list" in the *summary* field.\
Replace `<your-name>` with your name.\ 
Click on the button that says `Commit 1 file`.

<img style="left;" src="assets/fork-commit3.png" alt="commit your changes" />

In the branches view, you can see that a new commit is added.

<img style="left;" src="assets/fork-commit4.png" alt="Check your commit" />

## Push changes to GitHub

![](assets/fork-push-icon.png | height=20) Click on the "Push" icon in the toolbar or on `Repository` > `Push...` .

<img style="left;" src="assets/fork-push1.png" alt="log-in to Github" />

## Submit your changes for review

If you go to your repository on github, you'll see  `Compare & pull request` button. click on that button.

<img style="left;" src="assets/compare-and-pull.png" alt="create a pull request" />

Now submit the pull request.

<img style="left;" src="assets/submit-pull-request.png" alt="submit pull request" />

Soon I'll be merging all your changes into the master branch of this project. You will get a notification email once the changes have been merged.
