# Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

In the interest of fostering an open, educative, learning and welcoming environment, we as
contributors and maintainers pledge to make participation in our project and to make
our community a harassment-free and supportive experience for everyone regardless of age, body
size, disability, ethnicity, gender identity, colour, creed, expression, level of experience,
nationality, sexual identity and
orientation.

## Our Standards

Examples of behaviour that contributes to creating a positive environment
include:

*   Using welcoming and inclusive language.
*   Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences.
*   Gracefully accepting constructive criticism.
*   Focusing on what is best for the community.
*   Showing empathy towards other community members.
*   Being supportive and unbiased.

Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include:

*   The use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or advances.
*   The use of illicit content.
*   Being unprofession at any point of time.
*   Favouritism is unacceptable.
*   Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks.
*   Public or private harassment.
*   Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or electronic address, without explicit permission.
*   Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting.

## Our Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying and maintaining the standards of acceptable
behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective measures in
response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or
reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions
that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, or to ban temporarily or
permanently any contributor for other behaviors that they deem inappropriate,
threatening, offensive, or harmful.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies both within project spaces and in public spaces
when an individual is representing the project or its community. Examples of
representing a project or community include using an official project e-mail
address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed
representative at an online or offline event. Representation of a project may be
further defined and clarified by project maintainers.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be
reported by contacting [roshanjossey@gmail.com](mailto:roshanjossey@gmail.com).
All complaints will be reviewed and investigated and will result in a response
that is deemed necessary and appropriate to the circumstances. The project team
is obligated to maintain confidentiality regarding the reporter of an
incident. Further details of specific enforcement policies may be posted
separately.
